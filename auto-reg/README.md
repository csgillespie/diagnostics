========================================

This example comes from  Milner, P, et al, 2013 ([doi](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11222-011-9310-8))

## Overview

 * The C directory contains (C code) for the moment closure approximation and code for the direct simulation.
 * The R directory contains R code for mainly plotting the results.
 * The data directory contains simulator output. In theory, it should be possible to easily regenerate the results.
